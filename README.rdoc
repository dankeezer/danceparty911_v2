DANCEPARTY911
=============

A simple DJ app that loads two playlists simultaneously with music sourced from the Internet.

Current Services:
- Soundcloud

Future Services:
- Spotify
- Local Files
- YouTube
- Rdio

TODO

- create Parties based on sessions? When a User clicks to PLAY a Track that Track is 
- stored (in order) in a Party playlist that defaults to date.
- e.g. http://danceparty911.com/tracks/dankeezer/Nov082013
- then you can determine live playlist building.
- anonymous user tracking (metadata)

WISH LIST

Here are several features that I'd like to include beyond basic functionality.

- Crossfade (javascript)
- Sort / Search
- Mono-conversion with left/right preview/live functionality (would require a 1/8" phono splitter)
- Queue suggestions
- Suggestions based on data provided by user (i.e. The Rapture was cool when you went to college, and this party has a similar age group, play that.
- Social-network party login for automatic party demographic detection.
- BPM detection
- Strobe light that flashes at BPM interval.
